I am a postdoctoral researcher in the
[Advanced Software Technologies](https://ast.ethz.ch/)
group at ETH Zurich, under the guidance of
Prof [Zhendong Su](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/).
I completed my PhD at the
[Athens University of Economics and Business](https://aueb.gr)
working in the areas of programming languages, program analysis, and testing under the
supervision of Prof [Diomidis Spinellis](https://spinellis.gr).
I hold an MSc with distinction in Advanced Computing from
[Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk) and I have previously
worked as a software engineer at the
[Greek Research and Technology Network (GRNET)](https://grnet.gr).
I was also an intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS
) where I worked on the design and implementation
of static analysis techniques for detecting security issues.
For my detailed CV, please follow this [link](./assets/pdf/theosot_cv.pdf).

My research focuses on **designing and building practical tools**
that automate various tasks across the software development pipeline,
such as code analysis,
test input generation,
and fault detection.
To achieve this,
I leverage and advance programming language technologies,
including formal models, program analysis techniques (both static and dynamic),
randomized automated testing (fuzzing),
and empirical software engineering methods.
